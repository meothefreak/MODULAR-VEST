## Patterns

The vest pattern is provided in two formats:

- **A0 PDF** for large-format plotters  
- **A4 segmented PDF** for standard printers  

The A4 version is designed to be assembled manually following the included assembly guide.  
Patterns can be resized or modified to fit different body types or garment preferences.

## 3D Printed Components

Several tool supports are designed for **resin-based 3D printing**, chosen for its precision and ability to reproduce small details relevant to tool stability and safety.

### Recommended Printing Technology
- **Resin 3D printer (SLA / MSLA)**

### Suggested Material
- Standard or ABS-like photopolymer resin  
- Medium rigidity (not flexible, not brittle)

### Standard Printing Settings (Indicative)
These settings can be used as a starting point and adapted to specific printers and resins:

- Layer height: **0.05 mm**
- Exposure time (normal layers): **2–3 s** (depending on resin)
- Bottom layers: **4–6**
- Bottom exposure: **20–30 s**
- Infill: **solid**
- Orientation:  
  - angled to reduce suction  
  - critical surfaces facing upward when possible
- Supports:  
  - light to medium supports  
  - avoid contact points on functional edges

### Post-Processing
- Wash in isopropyl alcohol  
- UV cure according to resin manufacturer instructions  
- Light sanding may be applied on non-functional surfaces

The STL files are intended as **modifiable starting points**, not fixed solutions.

## Assembly and Modularity

The vest and tool supports are designed around a **hook-and-loop (Velcro) system**, used both as a functional solution and as a prototyping strategy.

Velcro allows:
- rapid repositioning of tools  
- task-specific configurations  
- adaptation to individual preferences  

This modularity is intentional and should be preserved or reinterpreted in future adaptations.

## Documentation and Replicability

All files are accompanied by documentation explaining:
- design rationale  
- tool positioning logic  
- observed limitations and possible improvements  

The goal is not to provide a finalized product, but a **transparent and transferable design process**.
